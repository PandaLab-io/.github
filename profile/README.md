##  About Us
PandaLab is a small anonymous team of passionate developers and creators.  
We build open-source tools, experimental apps, and design systems — focused on **clarity**, **usability**, and **freedom**.

Our mission is to craft digital experiences that are:
-  **Smart** — clear, minimal, and technically solid  
-  **Kiss & Beautiful** — design-driven: simple and accessible  
-  **Open** — shared with the world through transparent code
